  description: "The tutorial aims at summarizing the lessons learned during the last ten years with multipath transport to enable SIGCOMM attendees to correctly apply those emerging protocols. More precisely, our tutorial’s objectives are the following:
<ul>
    <li>Understand the benefits and challenges of using multiple paths in the transport layer</li>
    <li>Understand the design assumptions and principles of Multipath TCP</li>
    <li>Understand how the security and flexibility features of QUIC have enabled a cleaner design for Multipath QUIC</li>
    <li>Discover the impact of the algorithms that implementations use to manage the different paths: path manager, packet scheduler and the required adaptations to the congestion control scheme</li>
</ul>
At the end of the tutorial, the attendees will be able to determine when and how multipath transport can be applied to their use cases. They will also have a more in-depth understanding of the impact of the packet scheduling, congestion control and path management mechanisms on the performance of these protocols."

  description: "Internet transport protocols usually evolve slowly.
Any significant evolution to TCP, the dominant transport protocol,
takes years of efforts to be widely deployed. There are several
factors that explain this slow evolution. QUIC,
initially proposed by Google, addresses those issues
and brings back innovation in the transport layer.
The results obtained by Google with QUIC combined
with its security features have convinced the IETF to standardise a new protocol starting from Google’s initial design.
While the protocol specification is currently being finalised, QUIC brings a number of challenges and opportunities.
<br/>
In this tutorial, we first give an introduction to the QUIC protocol by detailing the context that lead to its inception, its principles and core mechanisms.
Then we discuss the practical challenges arising from QUIC's design, ranging from its specification complexity to the system performance aspects involved in making efficient user-space transport implementations.
Finally, we survey existing works from the research community to highlight the new opportunities of transport layer innovation brought by QUIC such as transport-layer Forward Erasure Correction and Multipath support."
