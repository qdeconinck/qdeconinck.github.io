- title: "Pluginizing QUIC"
  image: pquic.png
  description: We revisited the extensibility model of transport protocols by using plugins. The dynamic insertion of bytecode inside a running implementation let the connection adapt to the application it serves. We managed to implement various QUIC extensions (montoring, Multipath, Datagram, Forward Erasure Correction) only with plugins.

  description: Our first analysis of Multipath TCP in the smartphone environment. Our results showed that applications can use multiple wireless networks without modifying them, but it also highlighted the need for an adaptation of Multipath TCP to this particular use case.

  description: We designed and implemented an adapted version of Multipath TCP on Android smartphones. We showed that our version keeps the cellular consumption low while keeping advantage of the multiple wireless networks when the device moves.
