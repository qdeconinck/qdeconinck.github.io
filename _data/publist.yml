- title: "Core QUIC: Enabling Dynamic, Implementation-Agnostic Protocol Extensions"
  image: corequic.png
  description: Core QUIC introduces a framework in which *any* Core QUIC-compliant implementation can be safely extended using dynamically loaded plugins. We demonstrated the feasibility of our approach by making two popular QUIC implementations, Cloudflare's `quiche` and `quinn`, Core QUIC compliant.

- title: "URLink: Using Names As Sole Internet Addresses to Tackle Scanning Attacks in IoT"
  image: urlink.jpg
  description: The Internet has never connected so many devices as of today, with an increasing number of constrained/IoT devices being publicly reachable over the public Internet, and therefore scannable through IP address enumeration. This work questions the current TCP/IP architecture of the current Internet and envisions a network whose names, such as URLs, are the only information the client needs to know to reach the wanted service.

- title: "xBGP: Faster Innovation in Routing Protocols"
  image: xbgp.png
  description: How can we quickly deploy new BGP features in a network made of devices from different vendors? xBGP addresses this issue by proposing a vendor-neutral API enabling network operators to dynamically inject plugins in all xBGP-compliant implementations. We made FRRouting and BIRD xBGP-compliant and implemented different use-cases such as valley-free path checks and prefix origin validation. We also proposed a framework verifing the behavior of the injected plugins.

- title: "Pluginizing QUIC"
  image: pquic.png
  description: We revisited the extensibility model of transport protocols by using plugins. The dynamic insertion of bytecode inside a running implementation let the connection adapt to the application it serves. We managed to implement various QUIC extensions (montoring, Multipath, Datagram, Forward Erasure Correction) only with plugins.

  description: Our first analysis of Multipath TCP in the smartphone environment. Our results showed that applications can use multiple wireless networks without modifying them, but it also highlighted the need for an adaptation of Multipath TCP to this particular use case.
